"""
Script to automate the k8s-operator charms release process.

The implementation works as a state machine that queries the current state of each track
and then decides what to do next.The script is designed to be idempotent, meaning that it
can be run multiple times without causing any harm.

For each track to be published on stable from candidate, there are more than one revisions 
that need to be tested, each corresponding to a unique (arch, base) of each charm for which 
a revision has been published. We call the set of all such revisions a revision matrix of a 
track. For example track 1.32 of k8s can have the following matrix of revisions on candidate 
risk level:

        20.04   22.04   24.04
amd64   741     742     743
arm64   736     748     750

And the following matrix of revisions published on stable:

        20.04   22.04   24.04
amd64   456     457     458
arm64   459     460     461

The goal is to promote all 6 revisions of the 1.32/candidate to 1.32/stable. The same goes for 
k8s-worker charm and any other charm that might be needed to have a complete test. We call the 
revision matrices of all the necessary charms a bundle, which should not be confused with charm
bundles. 

for each track:
    for each charm: 
        get data for current track state:
        - extract all the revisions corresponding to each (arch, base) published on channel=<track>/candidate
        - extract all the revisions corresponding to each (arch, base) published on stable_channel=<track>/stable

    skip if all the charms have their revsions on <track>/candidate already published in <track>/stable
    
    for each (arch, base):
        extract the corresponding revision of each charm on channel=<track>/candidate
        try the following reconciliation pattern:

        revision is in one of the following states:
            - no TPIs yet -> NO_TEST
            - at least one TPI succeeded -> TEST_SUCCESS
            - at least one TPI in progress -> TEST_IN_PROGRESS
            - there are only failed/(in-)error TPIs -> TEST_FAILED

        Actions:
            - NO_TEST: start a new TPI
            - TEST_IN_PROGRESS: just print that as a log message
            - TEST_SUCCESS: promote the charm revisions to the next channel
            - TEST_FAILED: manual intervention with SQA required

    aggregate the results for all the revisions checked for each track:
        - If all revisions have TEST_SUCCESS then report the track state as succeeded 
        - If any of the revisions have TEST_FAILED then report the track state as failed 
        - If some of the tests are still in TEST_IN_PROGRESS report the track as in progress

TODOs:
* Support testing different architectures once SQA provides the feature
* Cleaning up outdated and aborted TPIs in a separate cronjob
